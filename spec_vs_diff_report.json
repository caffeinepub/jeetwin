  "summary": "The diff implements a comprehensive JeetWin website redesign covering navigation, hero carousel, category tabs, game cards, promotions, footer, and supporting hooks/data files. Most requirements are well-addressed. However, there are some gaps: the category tabs component uses categories from games.ts which has 'Live Casino' but no standalone 'Casino' tab as specified. Eight files were omitted from the diff including likely CSS/tailwind config files that would confirm full theme enforcement. The implementation appears largely complete with minor concerns.",
