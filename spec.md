# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a visually rich, single-page frontend for JeetWin Pro — a premium casino/sports betting landing page — with a gold, black, and crimson red theme, hero banner carousel, game grid, promotions section, and footer.

**Planned changes:**
- Sticky top navigation bar with JeetWin Pro logo (left), nav links (center: Home, Sports, Casino, Promotions, About), and Login/Register buttons (right); collapses to hamburger menu on mobile
- Full-width hero section with auto-playing carousel of 5 banner slides, each with headline, subheadline, CTA button, prev/next arrows, and dot indicators
- Horizontal scrollable category tab bar (Cricket, Football, Casino, Slots, Live Casino, Card Games, Lottery) with icons; active tab highlighted in gold; filters the game grid below
- Responsive featured games grid (2 cols mobile / 4 cols desktop) with game cards showing banner image, title, and "Play Now" button; cards have hover scale + glow effects
- Promotional offers section with 3 cards (Welcome Bonus 200%, Refer a Friend, Daily Cashback), each showing banner image, title, description, and "Claim Now" button
- Footer with Quick Links, Games, and Support columns, social media icons, legal disclaimer text; dark background with gold accent text
- Gold (#FFD700), deep black (#0A0A0A), and crimson red (#C0132F) color palette applied consistently with bold typography and neon/glow accents throughout
- All images served as static assets from `/assets/generated/`

**User-visible outcome:** Users see a polished, casino-style landing page with an animated hero banner, browsable game categories, featured game cards, promotional offers, and a complete footer — all in a premium gold/black/red theme.
